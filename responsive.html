                It's impossible to know how genuinely worried Donald Trump may be about the prospect of going to jail for any of the
                criminal offences he has been charged with.
            </p>
            <p>
                He claims he could be facing a combined 561 years in prison thanks to the "Left's witch hunts". That may be an
                exaggeration, but if he is convicted in any of the three court cases he faces, a jail sentence may well follow.
            </p>
            <p>
                So whilst Mr Trump says almost nothing during his court appearances, he is voluble outside when he is appealing to the
                court of public opinion. Looking for a verdict that will come from tens of millions of voters, not a jury of 12.
                Delivered at the ballot box, not in a courtroom.
            </p>
            <p>
                The lesser-known former congressman Will Hurd was booed off stage at a Republican dinner in Iowa last week when he said
                the only reason Mr Trump is running for the White House is to stay out of jail. But is he completely wrong?
            </p>
            <p>
                The former president has already woven his election campaign and legal problems tightly together.
            </p>
            <p>
                He uses the charges against him as a major plank of his campaign. In speeches he tells his supporters that he is being
                prosecuted because the establishment - or the "deep state"- fear him being re-elected as president.
            </p>
            <p>
                He sends out fundraising emails that say: "If these illegal persecutions succeed, if they're allowed to set fire to the
                law, then it will not stop with me. Their grip will close even tighter around YOU."
